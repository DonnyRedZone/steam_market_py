<h3> Find those annoying Market Hash names</h3>

`SteamMarket.get_hash_name("query")`
<br> searches what you enter as your query and returns the proper market hash name usable in the rest of the code
<br> it picks whatever is most relevant to your search , so it's helpful to be a bit more specific

<br> returns :
<br> `AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)`

<h4>`SteamMarket.get_current_price (appid , hash_name , mode*, currency*) ` *-optional 
<br> Gets the current price of the item </h4>
<br> `currency` default - USD 
<br> numeric value corresponding to the currency you would like to make the call for
<br> you probabally want to add this dict somewhere in your code
<br> `curAbbrev = {

    'EUR' : 3,
    'CHF' : 4,

<br><br> 1. Uses Steam's Standard Api , Very Fast , Updates are slow ,Returns the lowest sell order , Api calls limited to 20 in 1 minute (put a 3 second wait between calls)
<br><br> 2. Uses Web Scraping to get current price , Slower in comparison , Updates as soon as there is a change in the lowest sell order , Returns the lowest sell order , No Call limit , DOES NOT NEED COOKIES ! , CANNOT CHANGE CURRENCY ALWAYS YOUR HOME CURRENCY
<br><br> 3. Uses Steam's Standard **History** Api , Very Fast , Updates as soon as there is a sale , Returns the price the last item actually sold for , No call limit , cannot change currency , stays as USD (Im planning on adding the option to change this to your home one by using cookies) 
<br><br> Example:
<br> `SteamMarket.get_current_price(730 , 'AK-47 | Redline (Field-Tested)' , 1 , 3)`
